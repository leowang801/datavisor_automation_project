# Running the tests
- Ensure you are using Python version 3.11 by running `pipenv --version`
- Run `pipenv shell`
- `cd` into the `tests` directory
- Run `python bugbug_tests.py`
# Future Changes
- Automatically delete all projects when starting the tests
- Run multiple test cases in a single driver window. This will cut down on the time spent logging in.
